    "The goal is to build a recommender using [Spark's ALS (Alternating Least Squares)](https://spark.apache.org/docs/2.3.0/ml-collaborative-filtering.html) and then generate recommendations for a given user.\n",

    "Since the dataset is quite big, you should pick a business category (e.g. Restaurants) and a city (e.g. Edinburgh) and work on the recommender using only this subset of the data.\n",
