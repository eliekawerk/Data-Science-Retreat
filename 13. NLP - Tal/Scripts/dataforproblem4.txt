As the most important divinity in Ancient Rome , many temples were built to honor Jupiter or the entire Capitoline Triad -LRB- consisting of Jupiter , Juno , and Minerva -RRB- in towns newly conquered by the Romans .

However , as historians of science such as Michael Ghiselin and Stephen Jay Gould have pointed out , none of these views were original to Lamarck .
The identification of Lamarckism with the inheritance of acquired characteristics is regarded by some as an artifact of the subsequent history of evolutionary thought , repeated in textbooks without analysis .
Stephen Jay Gould wrote that late 19th century evolutionists `` re-read Lamarck , cast aside the guts of it ... and elevated one aspect of the mechanics - inheritance of acquired characters - to a central focus it never had for Lamarck himself . ''
Gould advocated defining `` Lamarckism '' more broadly , in line with Lamarck 's overall evolutionary theory .
He argued that `` the restriction of `` Lamarckism '' to this relatively small and non-distinctive corner of Lamarck 's thought must be labeled as more than a misnomer , and truly a discredit to the memory of a man and his much more comprehensive system '' .
On the contrary , Lamarck 's contribution was a systematic theoretical framework for understanding evolution .

Distributions are normally segmented into packages .
Distributions optimized for size may not contain X and tend to use more compact alternatives to the GNU utilities , such as Busybox , uClibc , or dietlibc .
There are currently over six hundred Linux distributions .
Linux distributions began to appear very soon after the Linux kernel was first used by individuals other than the original Linux programmers who were more interested in developing the operating system than developing application programs , the user interface , or convenient packaging .
Before the first Linux distributions , a would-be Linux user was required to be something of a Unix expert , needing to know not only what libraries and executables were required to successfully get the system to boot and run , but also important details concerning configuration and placement of files in the system .
Each package contains a specific application or service .

Each lichen is a flat patch bordered by a black line of spores .
If the growth rate is known , the maximum lichen size will give a minimum age for when this rock was deposited .
Map lichen is a lichen widely used by climatologists in determining the relative age of deposits , e.g. moraine systems , thus revealing evidence of glacial advances .

Lichenometry is based on the assumption that the largest lichen growing on a rock is the oldest individual .

That is , any problem in NP can be reduced in polynomial time by a deterministic Turing machine to the problem of determining whether a Boolean formula is satisfiable .
An important consequence of the theorem is that if there exists a deterministic polynomial time algorithm for solving Boolean satisfiability , then there exists a deterministic polynomial time algorithm for solving all problems in NP .
In computational complexity theory , the Cookâ `` Levin theorem , also known as Cook 's theorem , states that the Boolean satisfiability problem is NP-complete .
The question of whether such an algorithm exists is called the P versus NP problem and it is widely considered the most important unsolved problem in theoretical computer science .

Kangaroo mice are nocturnal , and are most active in the two hours following sunset .
The kangaroo mice are closely related to the kangaroo rats , which belong to the same subfamily , Dipodomyinae .

The name `` kangaroo mouse '' refers to the species ' extraordinary jumping ability , as well as its habit of bipedal locomotion .

Oceanic anoxic events or anoxic events occur when the Earth 's oceans become completely depleted of oxygen -LRB- O2 -RRB- below the surface levels .
Although anoxic events have not happened for millions of years , the geological record shows that they happened many times in the past .
There are currently several places on earth that are exhibiting the features of anoxic events on a localized level such as algae blooms and localized `` dead zones '' .
Dead zones exist off the East Coast of the United States in the Chesapeake Bay , in the Scandinavian strait Kattegat , the Black Sea -LRB- which may have been anoxic in its deepest levels for millennia , however -RRB- , in the northern Adriatic as well as a dead zone off the coast of Louisiana .
It is believed oceanic anoxic events are strongly linked to lapses in key oceanic current circulations , to climate warming and greenhouse gases .
Although anoxic events have not happened for millions of years , the geological record shows that they happened many times in the past . Anoxic events may have caused mass extinctions .
